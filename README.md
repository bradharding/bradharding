### Hello there! I’m Brad, you’re friendly neighbourhood code monkey! 👋

I made [*DOOM Retro*](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro), the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. And I continue to do so. It’s been somewhat of a passion project of mine, as you can no doubt tell, and I kinda work on it quite a lot. And coding ain’t even my day job! If my continued efforts towards this endeavour happen to please you, then consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/wiki/SPONSOR) me. Otherwise don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or bugs you wish to divulge. I’m almost always in a good mood, I promise!
