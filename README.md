### Hello there! I’m Brad, your friendly neighbourhood code monkey!

I’m the guy who works on [*DOOM Retro*](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro), the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. It’s been somewhat of a passion project of mine over these past few years, and as you can no doubt tell, I kinda work on it quite a lot. I’ve poured my absolute heart and soul into this fucking thing, and coding isn’t even my day job (for better or for worse)! If my persistent efforts happen to please you, would you then perhaps be ever so kind in 🩷[sponsoring](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=8WGJ8VDFSVU7J) *DOOM Retro*? Or at the very least don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or bugs you wish to share.
