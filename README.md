### Well, hello there! I’m Brad, you’re friendly neighborhood code monkey! 👋

I made *DOOM Retro*, the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. This has been somewhat of a passion project of mine, and as you can no doubt tell, I kinda work on it quite a lot. And coding ain't even my day job! Please, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions or bugs you want to share. I'm almost always in a good mood, I promise!
