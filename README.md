### Well, hello there! Iâ€™m Brad, youâ€™re friendly neighborhood code monkey! ðŸ‘‹

I made *DOOM Retro*, the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. Itâ€™s been somewhat of a passion project of mine, and as you can no doubt tell, I kinda work on it quite a lot. And coding ainâ€™t even my day job! Please, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions or bugs you want to share. Iâ€™m almost always in a good mood, I promise!
