## Hello there! :wave: I’m Brad, your friendly neighbourhood code monkey!

I’m the guy who made [*DOOM Retro*](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro), the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. It’s been somewhat of a passion project of mine, as you can no doubt tell, and I still kinda work on it quite a lot. And coding ain’t even my day job (for better or for worse)! If my persistent efforts in this endeavour happen to please you, would you then consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/wiki/SPONSOR) *DOOM Retro*? If not, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or bugs you wish to divulge. I’m almost always in a good mood, I promise!
