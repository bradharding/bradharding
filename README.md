### Hello there! :wave: I’m Brad, your friendly neighbourhood code monkey!

I’m the guy who made [*DOOM Retro*](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro), the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. It’s been somewhat of a passion project of mine over the years, as you can no doubt tell, and I kinda work on it quite a bit. I’ve poured my absolute heart and soul into this thing, and coding isn’t even my day job (for better or for worse). If my persistent efforts in this happen to please you, would you then perhaps be ever so kind to consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/wiki/SPONSOR) *DOOM Retro*? Or don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or bugs you wish to share.
